	<h1> Ancient Greece </h1>
	<p> Ancient Greece is widely considered the birthplace of western democracy. This fact alone creates many shared values between Greece and the United States. 
	     A democracy type government represents a society that believes strongly in freedom, human rights, and self determination. 
	     The word democracy comes from the Ancient Greek words for people, “demos”, and power,”kratos”(Ancient Greek Culture and Civilization). This translates to literally “power of the people”. 
	     This was a revolutionary way of governing at the time, with virtually every previous empire using some sort of autocracy system, but with this system of democracy every male of the age of 20 could participate in government and decide what was best for himself and the society around him(Ancient Greek Culture and Civilization). 
		 In the realm of philosophy, it is clear to see the value placed upon reason and inquiry. The impact of Ancient Grecian philosophers and 
		 thinkers shattered traditional views and the ideas and influences catalyzed certain world changing events such as the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. Philosophers and idealists such as Plato and Socrates wrote papers on the ethics and human life. 
		 Grecian art is crucial in telling modern day anthropologist what the ideologies and beliefs of the ancient Greek was consisted of. Marble sculptures such as the Venus de Milo display what technologies the 
		 Grecians had to craft with and what their religions were like. The architecture of Ancient Greece also does a wonderful job of signaling the characteristics of the Ancient Greeks. Architects toiled for the excellence and precision that the world knows Grecian structures by today. 
		 The Greek temple, such as the Temple of Zeus, gives the modern world an insight on the rituals, beliefs, and norms were like in Ancient Greece.
